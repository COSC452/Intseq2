# intseq2
A Clojure library designed to find closed-form expressions for integer sequences, using Genetic Programming (GP) techniques.
# Motivation
After browsing the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), we noticed that many of the sequences listed in their database did not have formulas. Since GP is frequently used to discover solutions to problems that humans don't (yet) know how to solve directly, we saw this as an opportunity to create a program that takes advantage of GP to find such missing formulas.
